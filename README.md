# Apache Spark mit Jupyter-Notebook

## Tutorial:
### Starting the Spark Architecture in Docker:
`docker-compose up --build --scale spark-worker=3 -d`
If you want to adjust the number of workers, change the spark-worker parameter.

**Important:** The first build may take some time (approx. 10 min) as the images need to be generated.
